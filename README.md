For Open Source or event maintainers that share a project twitter account, `twitter-together` is a GitHub Action that utilizes text files to publish tweets from a GitHub repository. Rather than tweeting directly, GitHub‚Äôs pull request review process encourages more collaboration, Twitter activity and editorial contributions by enabling everyone to submit tweet drafts to a project.

## Try it

You can submit a tweet to this repository to see the magic happen. Please follow the instructions at [tweets/README.md](tweets/README.md) and mention your own twitter username to the tweet. This repository is setup to tweet from [https://twitter.com/commit2tweet](https://twitter.com/commit2tweet).

## Twitter API compatibility

Twitter, Together uses the v2 Twitter API for most functionality.
It makes use of the v1 API for media uploads, as there is no v2 equivalent endpoint.

Essentials level Twitter access should grant access to all endpoints Twitter, Together uses.

## Setup

1. [Create a Twitter app](docs/01-create-twitter-app.md) with your shared Twitter account and store the credentials as `TWITTER_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` in your repository‚Äôs secrets settings.
2. [Create a `.github/workflows/twitter-together.yml` file](docs/02-create-twitter-together-workflow.md) with the content below. Make sure to replace `'main'` if you changed your repository's default branch.

   ```yml
   on: [push, pull_request]
   name: Twitter, together!
   jobs:
     preview:
       name: Preview
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
       steps:
         - uses: twitter-together/action@v2
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
     tweet:
       name: Tweet
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
       steps:
         - name: checkout main
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Tweet
           uses: twitter-together/action@v2
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
             TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
             TWITTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_KEY }}
             TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY }}
   ```

3. After creating or updating `.github/workflows/twitter-together.yml` in your repository‚Äôs default branch, a pull request will be created with further instructions.

Happy collaborative tweeting!

## How it works

`twitter-together` is using two workflows

1. `push` event to publish new tweets
2. `pull_request` event to validate and preview new tweets

_(Tweets can also be invoked locally by calling the script with the `--file` flag, which can be useful for development. E.g. `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=... node lib/index.js --file tweets/hello-world.tweet`)_

### The `push` event

When triggered by the `push` event, the script looks for added `*.tweet` files in the `tweets/` folder or subfolders. If there are any, a tweet for each added tweet file is published.

If there is no `tweets/` subfolder, the script opens a pull request creating the folder with further instructions.

### The `pull_request` event

For the `pull_request` event, the script handles only `opened` and `synchronize` actions. It looks for new `*.tweet` files in the `tweets/` folder or subfolders. If there are any, the length of each tweet is validated. If one is too long, a failed check run with an explanation is created. If all tweets are valid, a check run with a preview of all tweets is created.

### Advanced tweeting

Beyond tweeting out plain-text tweets, twitter-together also supports creating polls, replying to other tweets, retweeting or quote-retweeting other tweets, threading a chain of tweets, and adding images to tweets.

Polls can be included directly in the body of tweet like so:

```tweet
What is your favorite color?

( ) Red
( ) Blue
( ) Green
```

All other advanced tweeting features are supporting through defining YAML frontmatter in the tweet file.
Some frontmatter items can be combined together, where Twitter functionality supports it.

A poll can also be defined in frontmatter, rather than in the tweet body, like so:

```tweet
---
poll:
  - Red
  - Blue
  - Green
---

What is your favorite color?
```

To reply to another tweet, include the `reply` frontmatter item with the tweet link that you wish to reply to:

```tweet
---
reply: https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/1409601188362809349
---

@gr2m I love your work!
```

If you want to quote-retweet another tweet, include the `retweet` frontmatter item with the tweet link that you wish to quote-retweet.
If you'd prefer to just retweet without quoting, don't provide a tweet body after the frontmatter.

```tweet
---
retweet: https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/1409601188362809349
---

twitter-together is awesome!
```

To include media items with your tweet, include the `media` frontmatter item as an array with each item having a `file` property and an optional `alt` property.
The `file` property should be the name of a file within the `media` directory of your repository (same level as the `tweets` directory).

_(Note: Although alt text can be set in frontmatter, it is not yet actually passed to Twitter due to library limitations)._

```tweet
---
media:
  - file: cat.jpg
    alt: A cat
  - file: dog.jpg
    alt: A dog
---

Here are some cute animals!
```

To thread a chain of tweets, use `---` to delimit each tweet in the file. You can optionally set `threadDelimiter` in the frontmatter to change the delimiter for the next tweet in the thread. Each tweet in a thread supports its own frontmatter.

```tweet
---
media:
  - file: cat.jpg
    alt: A cat
  - file: dog.jpg
    alt: A dog
---

Here are some cute animals!

---
---
poll:
  - Cat
  - Dog
---

Which one is cuter?
```

## Motivation

I think we can make Open Source more inclusive to people with more diverse interests by making it easier to contribute other things than code and documentation. I see a particularly big opportunity to be more welcoming towards editorial contributions by creating tools using GitHub‚Äôs Actions, Apps and custom user interfaces backed by GitHub‚Äôs REST & GraphQL APIs.

I‚Äôve plenty more ideas that I‚Äôd like to build out. Please ping me on twitter if you‚Äôd like to chat: [@gr2m](https://twitter.com/gr2m).
