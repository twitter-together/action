# After your twitter app was approved

You need to get your account id. Open [ads.twitter.com](https://ads.twitter.com), press on "Go to Twitter Ads", then the part the 2nd segment of the URL path. For example if the new URL is

```
https://ads.twitter.com/onboarding/18ce551qf6o/welcome?onboarding=true
```

your twitter account id is `18ce551qf6o`. Now set `TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY` in your `twitter-together.yml` file.

```yml
on: [push, pull_request]
name: Twitter, together!
jobs:
  preview:
    name: Preview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    steps:
      - uses: gr2m/twitter-together@v1.x
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  tweet:
    name: Tweet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - name: checkout master
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Tweet
        uses: gr2m/twitter-together@v1.x
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
