# The tweets/ folder

To create a new tweet create a new `*.tweet` file in this `tweets/` folder. 

## Example

Create a new file `tweets/hello-world.tweet` with the content

> Hello, world!

You can use subfolders, e.g. `tweets/2019-02/hello-world.tweet`, as long as the file is in the `tweets/` folder and has the `.tweet` file extension
