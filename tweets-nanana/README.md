# The tweets/ folder

To create a new tweet create a new `*.tweet` file in this `tweets/` folder. 

<kbd>[Create new tweet](../../../new/master/?filename=tweets/<your-path>.tweet)</kbd>

## Example

Create a new file `tweets/hello-world.tweet` with the content

> Hello, world!

You can use subfolders, e.g. `tweets/2019-02/hello-world.tweet`, as long as the file is in the `tweets/` folder and has the `.tweet` file extension

## Notes

- Only newly created files are handled, deletions, updates or renames are ignored.
- `*.tweet` files will not be created for tweets you send out directly from twitter.com
